My job is teaching German as a foreign language. In my free time I like to play the guitar, watch movies and read. I am completly new in the world of programming and I am curious how far could I learn these things. English is not my native language but I'd like to write these posts in English because I'd like to improve. Sorry for the mistakes.

Gerineldo is a character in the book "One Hundred Years of Solitude", a novel by Gabriel García Márquez. Read it, it is wonderful.

The theme of the blog is Lagrange, it is a minimalist Jekyll, made by LeNPaul. Thank you.
